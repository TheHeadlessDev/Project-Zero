                <p>2nd Year CS Student | Tracking the Pivot to Full Stack.

                College is 90% theory and C programming. I’m spending my remaining time building the skills that actually get you hired.

                The Protocol: Project Zero
                Every day, I put in 4 hours of deep work outside of my college lectures:
                2 Hours: Data Structures & Algorithms (Python)
                2 Hours: Full Stack Web Development

                No fancy edits. No fake motivation. Just the raw grind of balancing academic pressure with real-world engineering.
